"B<sudo> allows a permitted user to execute a I<command> as the superuser or "
"another user, as specified in the I<sudoers> file.  The real and effective "
"uid and gid are set to match those of the target user as specified in the "
"passwd file (the group vector is also initialized when the target user is "
"not root).  By default, B<sudo> requires that users authenticate themselves "
"with a password (NOTE: by default this is the user's password, not the root "
"password).  Once a user has been authenticated, a timestamp is updated and "
"the user may then use sudo without a password for a short period of time "
