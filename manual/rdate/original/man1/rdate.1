.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B Rdate
uses TCP or UDP to retrieve the current time of another machine using
using the protocol described in RFC 868.
The time for each system is returned in
ctime(3) format. The following is an example:
.nf
.IP ""
% rdate uci mc
[uci]   Sun Mar 24 20:35:41 1985
[mc]    Sun Mar 24 20:36:19 1985
.fi
.SS OPTIONS
.TP
.I \-p
Print the time retrieved from the remote machines.  This is the default
mode.
.TP
.I \-s
Set the local system time from the time retrieved from the remote
machine.  This, quite naturally, is only effective for root.
.TP
.I \-u
Use UDP to retrieve the time instead of TCP.
The client will timeout if no reply is received within 5 seconds.
.SH FILES
.nf
/etc/services	map service name to socket number

Timeout handling on UDP doesn't work after the first server.
Something to do with signal(2) semantics I don't understand.
