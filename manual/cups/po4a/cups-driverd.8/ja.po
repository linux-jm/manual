"uncompressed PPD file."

"original IPP request - 0 means no limit. Finally, the I<options> argument is "
"a space-delimited list of attributes (\"name=value name=value \\&...\") that "
"were passed in with the request. Currently I<cups-driverd> looks for the "
"I<ppd-make> and I<requested-attributes> attributes and tailors the output "
