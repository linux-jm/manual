fopencookie \- opening a custom stream

\fBFILE *fopencookie(void *\fP\fIcookie\fP\fB, const char *\fP\fImode\fP\fB,\fP
\fB                  cookie_io_functions_t \fP\fIio_funcs\fP\fB);\fP
.fi
.SH 説明
The \fBfopencookie\fP()  function allows the programmer to create a custom
implementation for a standard I/O stream.  This implementation can store the
stream's data at a location of its own choosing; for example,
\fBfopencookie\fP()  is used to implement \fBfmemopen\fP(3), which provides a
stream interface to data that is stored in a buffer in memory.

In order to create a custom stream the programmer must:
.IP * 3
Implement four "hook" functions that are used internally by the standard I/O
library when performing I/O on the stream.
.IP *
Define a "cookie" data type, a structure that provides bookkeeping
information (e.g., where to store data) used by the aforementioned hook
functions.  The standard I/O package knows nothing about the contents of
this cookie (thus it is typed as \fIvoid\ *\fP when passed to
\fBfopencookie\fP()), but automatically supplies the cookie as the first
argument when calling the hook functions.
.IP *
Call \fBfopencookie\fP()  to open a new stream and associate the cookie and
hook functions with that stream.
.PP
The \fBfopencookie\fP()  function serves a purpose similar to \fBfopen\fP(3): it
opens a new stream and returns a pointer to a \fIFILE\fP object that is used to
operate on that stream.

The \fIcookie\fP argument is a pointer to the caller's cookie structure that is
to be associated with the new stream.  This pointer is supplied as the first
argument when the standard I/O library invokes any of the hook functions
described below.

The \fImode\fP argument serves the same purpose as for \fBfopen\fP(3).  The
following modes are supported: \fIr\fP, \fIw\fP, \fIa\fP, \fIr+\fP, \fIw+\fP, and \fIa+\fP.
See \fBfopen\fP(3)  for details.

The \fIio_funcs\fP argument is a structure that contains four fields pointing
to the programmer\-defined hook functions that are used to implement this
stream.  The structure is defined as follows
.in +4n
.nf

struct cookie_io_functions_t {
    cookie_read_function_t  *read;
    cookie_write_function_t *write;
    cookie_seek_function_t  *seek;
    cookie_close_function_t *close;
};

.fi
.in
The four fields are as follows:
.TP 
\fIcookie_read_function_t *read\fP
This function implements read operations for the stream.  When called, it
receives three arguments:

    ssize_t read(void *cookie, char *buf, size_t size);

The \fIbuf\fP and \fIsize\fP arguments are, respectively, a buffer into which
input data can be placed and the size of that buffer.  As its function
result, the \fIread\fP function should return the number of bytes copied into
\fIbuf\fP, 0 on end of file, or \-1 on error.  The \fIread\fP function should
update the stream offset appropriately.

If \fI*read\fP is a NULL pointer, then reads from the custom stream always
return end of file.
.TP 
\fIcookie_write_function_t *write\fP
This function implements write operations for the stream.  When called, it
receives three arguments:

    ssize_t write(void *cookie, const char *buf, size_t size);

The \fIbuf\fP and \fIsize\fP arguments are, respectively, a buffer of data to be
output to the stream and the size of that buffer.  As its function result,
the \fIwrite\fP function should return the number of bytes copied from \fIbuf\fP,
or \-1 on error.  The \fIwrite\fP function should update the stream offset
appropriately.

If \fI*write\fP is a NULL pointer, then output to the stream is discarded.
.TP 
\fIcookie_seek_function_t *seek\fP
This function implements seek operations on the stream.  When called, it
receives three arguments:

    int seek(void *cookie, off64_t *offset, int whence);

The \fI*offset\fP argument specifies the new file offset depending on which of
the following three values is supplied in \fIwhence\fP:
.RS
.TP  10
\fBSEEK_SET\fP
The stream offset should be set \fI*offset\fP bytes from the start of the
stream.
.TP 
\fBSEEK_CUR\fP
\fI*offset\fP should be added to the current stream offset.
.TP 
\fBSEEK_END\fP
The stream offset should be set to the size of the stream plus \fI*offset\fP.
.RE
.IP
Before returning, the \fIseek\fP function should update \fI*offset\fP to indicate
the new stream offset.

As its function result, the \fIseek\fP function should return 0 on success, and
\-1 on error.

If \fI*seek\fP is a NULL pointer, then it is not possible to perform seek
operations on the stream.
.TP 
\fIcookie_close_function_t *close\fP
This function closes the stream.  The hook function can do things such as
freeing buffers allocated for the stream.  When called, it receives one
argument:

    int close(void *cookie);

The \fIcookie\fP argument is the cookie that the programmer supplied when
calling \fBfopencookie\fP().

As its function result, the \fIclose\fP function should return 0 on success,
and \fBEOF\fP on error.

If \fI*close\fP is NULL, then no special action is performed when the stream is
closed.
.SH 返り値
.\" .SH ERRORS
.\" It's not clear if errno ever gets set...
On success \fBfopencookie\fP()  returns a pointer to the new stream.  On error,
NULL is returned.
.SH 準拠
This function is a nonstandard GNU extension.
.SH 例
The program below implements a custom stream whose functionality is similar
(but not identical) to that available via \fBfmemopen\fP(3).  It implements a
stream whose data is stored in a memory buffer.  The program writes its
command\-line arguments to the stream, and then seeks through the stream
reading two out of every five characters and writing them to standard
output.  The following shell session demonstrates the use of the program:
.in +4n
.nf

$\fB ./a.out \(aqhello world\(aq\fP
/he/
/ w/
/d/
Reached end of file

.fi
.in
Note that a more general version of the program below could be improved to
more robustly handle various error situations (e.g., opening a stream with a
cookie that already has an open stream; closing a stream that has already
been closed).
